# Sports Betting Agent

This is an agent created with bitte.wallet, that allows users to make informed decision about sports betting. Since custom agents are not able to use on a testnet environment it is unable to place bets. I created a smart contract that allows for betting on NEAR, but this is in another repo.  

## Functions 

### Get Active Leagues 
This function uses TheOdds API, to fetch an active list of leagues that you can bet on.
